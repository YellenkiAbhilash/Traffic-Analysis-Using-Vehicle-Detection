## ðŸš— Vehicle Detection & Traffic Alert System
# Overview
This is a real-time vehicle detection and alert system built with Flask, OpenCV, and YOLOv8. The system captures video from two regions (e.g., Region A via webcam and Region B via video file), performs object detection to count vehicles, and displays a live stream via a web interface. It includes a simple vehicle tracking module and integrates with PHP scripts for emergency and traffic alerts.

# Features
